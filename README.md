changedetection
==============================

Remote Sensing Project in Collaboration with NUS

### Library Developers

You need to create a Python virtual environment for this project. We recommend you install and use
[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Once installed, create the environment:

```sh
conda create -y --name=changedetection python=3.8
```

activate it:

```sh
conda activate changedetection
```

and install the project in "development mode" (note, you must be in the project's toplevel directory
for issuing this command):

```sh
pip install -e "."
```

initiate pre-commit:
```sh
pre-commit install
```

To launch the test suite, change to the project root directory and run:
```sh
pytest src/test/
```
